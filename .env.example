That's how to create a ".env" file:

1. Create a New Text File: Right-click in the directory where you want to create the .env file, then select "New" and "Text Document" (on Windows) or use the touch command (on Unix-based systems) to create a new file. Name the file .env. The leading dot (.) is important to make it a hidden file.
2. Open the File: Double-click the .env file to open it in a text editor. If prompted to choose a program, you can select any text editor you prefer (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
3. Add Environment Variables: In the .env file, you'll add your environment variables in the format KEY=VALUE. For example:
    PASSWORD=your_password_here
    USERNAME=your_username_here

***Replace your_password_here and your_username_here with your actual sensitive information.
